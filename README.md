# LogisticalBudget
This project contains code for comparing or ranking APT capabilities and operational capacity. The metrics are meant to quantify, rank, order, compare, or visualise quickly threat actors demonstrated operational capacities. In other words, it is meant to answer questions like 'Which APT produces the most binaries yearly', or 'which apt uses the most daomains'.
